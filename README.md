## Welcome to the Collect The Munch App

This is an interactive app that allows you to play a QR code scanning game at the MUNCH museum, view events filtered to your interests and leave reviews on your favourite ones. 

This uses a restful API to send requests to the backend where it saves and retrieves information from our azure database. To run the app, you need to enter the src/main/Frontend/collect-the-munch-app folder and install expo, then run npm install, and then npm start. The app can then be started in browser on on the expo phone app by scanning the QR code. 

The backend is deployed to azure server to make it accessible from anywhere at the address https://findthemunchgame.azurewebsites.net/ 
Here you can make API calls as show in our api documentation https://egms-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mama014_egms_no/ERoM_Ec4UU1Kpi-CeUSCOkEBWTCcZXQQcBeEZfQ4i-Smlw
